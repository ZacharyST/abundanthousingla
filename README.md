R source code for data-driven research I've done for Abundant Housing LA's blog.
These CSV files contain the city of Los Angeles' dataset on housing permits and certificates of occupancy for 2013-18.
The R code uses those datasets to visualize ZIP-code level trends in new housing construction, overlaid on a Google Map.
I wrote an article on Abundant Housing LA's blog on November 12, 2018 summarizing this research:
