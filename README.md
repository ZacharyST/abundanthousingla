R source code for data-driven research I've done for Abundant Housing LA's blog.
The CSV files in this folder contain the city of Los Angeles' dataset on the location of new housing permits and Metro stations.
The R file contains code that tabulates the number of new Expo Line-adjacent homes and maps their location.
This analysis formed the basis for an article I published on Abundant Housing LA's blog on January 6, 2019.
